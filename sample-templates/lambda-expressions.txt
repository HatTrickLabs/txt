Hello {FirstName} {LastName},

We see that your current address is as follows:
{(CurrentAddress) => formatAddress}

We also see that you have the following certifications:
{(Certifications, "| ") => join}

Now we are going to render some localities in alternating colors:
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>City</th>
    <th>State</th>
  </tr>
{#each Localities-}
  <tr class='{() => getRowCssClass}'>
    <td>{$.City}</td>
    <td>{$.State}</td>
  </tr>
{/each-}
</table>
