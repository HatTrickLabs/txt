Hello {Contact.Name.First} {Contact.Name.Last},

Following is a simple test of shifting scope via the with tag.

{#with Structure.Address}
Address:
{> () => GetAddressPartial}{! this partial has no context outside it's address properties }
{/with}

Following is test for shifting forward and backword through 
the scope chain via the with tag and the ..\ shift construct

{#with Structure}
	{#with Address}
Name Again: {..\..\Contact.Name.First}
Built: {..\YearBuilt}
	{/with}
{/with}
